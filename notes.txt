Max Notes

02 - Scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 question for scope (4rules)
1) Was th fn called with new?
2) Was th fn called with 'call' or 'apply' specifying an explicit this?
3) Was th fn called via a containing/owning object(context)?
4) Default: global object (except strict mode = undefined)

4rules
new keyword
explicit(call/apply/bind)
implicit(obj declaration)
global(default)


03 - Closures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a function remembers its lexical scope, even when the
Function is executing outside its lexical scope

Classic Module Pattern
1.- there must be an outer enclosing 
2.- From inside of that function is must return at least one inner function (that have a closure)
Encapsulation
Export

Tradeoff of module pattern
1.- test inner stuff hard or impossible
2.- create a new module i am creating a whole new copy of all that internal functions
